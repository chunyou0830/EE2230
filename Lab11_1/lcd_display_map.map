      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   252 out of   2,278   11%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        28 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          835
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           248 out of     835   29%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   4 out of     835    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         583 out of     835   69%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              31 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
